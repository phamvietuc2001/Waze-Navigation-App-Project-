# **Waze-Navigation-App-Project**

### **In this project, is divided into six portfolio projects represented in each course:** 
* The 1st is the `project proposal`, which is the outlined milestones that need to be completed in each phase from the beginning to end throughout the whole project (course 1).
* The 2nd is to begin exploring the dataset by using `Python` (course 2). 
* The 3rd is to dig deeper into the dataset by performing the `Exploratory Data Analysis` process and `visualizations` (course 3).
* The 4th is to perform `A/B testing` (using a two-sample t-test) to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average amount of rides between `Android` and `iPhone` users (course 4). 
* The 5th is to develop a `binomial logistic regression model` to predict the probability of churned user rate based on the number of features (course 5).
* The final phase is to develop the `machine-learning models` (Random Forest and XGBoost classifications) to predict the churn user rate and address features that have the most influence on whether or not users churn (course 6).

#### Each portfolio (course) project included the **PACE strategy document** and **executive summary**:
* PACE document stands for **Plan-Analyze-Construct-Execute**, which is to outline the needed steps to take to complete the project.
* The executive summary is a **one-page format** report, that summarizes the key results & information of the project to the cross-functional team members and stakeholders, and recommends the next steps to take.

#### Besides, there also included the CSV file of the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook for Python coding.

### Here is the scenario for the project: 
**Waze’s** free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent **user churn** on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have **uninstalled the Waze app** or **stopped using the app**. This project focuses on **monthly user churn**. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine-learning model that predicts user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help **prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business**. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

* Who are the users most likely to churn?

* Why do users churn? 

* When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why. 

Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s **retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions** about product development.
